# EXAI-group-project (group MFBSEG)

Repo for Explainable AI group assignment

For this project we will use the CRAN drug prediction dataset containing records of 1885 respondents regarding their use of 18 types of drugs, and their measurements on 12 predictors, which include demographic information as well as responses to various personality tests.

For this project we intend to explore how the missuse of such a dataset could lead to potentially disastrous consequences, by training some models to predict drug use and then employing EX AI methods to determine how these models make their predictions.
